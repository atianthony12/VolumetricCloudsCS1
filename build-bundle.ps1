# Rebuilds the cloud shader AssetBundles with Unity 5.6 -- one per platform -- checks what
# each one holds, and drops them where the mod embeds them. Run this after editing anything
# under UnityProject\Assets, then rebuild the mod.
#
#   .\build-bundle.ps1
#
# What it checks, and why:
# - Unity's log for "Shader error" / "Shader warning": a shader that fails to compile still
#   produces a bundle (containing a broken shader) and exit code 0.
# - tools\bundle-apis.ps1 on EACH BUNDLE THAT SHIPS (they are built uncompressed for that
#   reason): every shader named in BundleBuilder.cs must be in it, with real code for every
#   graphics API of its platform. Unity leaves an EMPTY 4-byte blob, no message, exit 0, for
#   an API it cannot compile a shader for (Metal at `#pragma target 4.0`), and a bundle
#   without the API the game runs is a stand-down in every city.
# - Each bundle's hash before and after, printed: an edit confined to a .cginc once produced
#   a byte-identical stale bundle (ForceRebuild in BundleBuilder is what prevents it now, and
#   the printed state is how to see that it did). Bundle builds are deterministic, so
#   UNCHANGED after a shader edit is a problem and UNCHANGED without one is expected.
