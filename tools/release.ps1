# Stages a Workshop update, so that the only thing left to do by hand is the click in the
# game's Content Manager. Every step checks itself and the script STOPS at the first thing
# that is not right; nothing it does is hard to undo (the one folder it takes away is moved,
# not deleted).

#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\release.ps1           # the real thing
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Checks the release is ready: the game is closed, the git tree is committed, Mod.Version
#      is newer than the last v* tag, CHANGELOG.md has that version dated (not "unreleased"), and
#      all three shader bundles were built from the current sources (build-bundle.ps1 -All).
#   2. Builds (which deploys to Addons\Mods) and checks the deployed DLL carries Mod.Version.
#   3. Runs every offline test, including the Metal (Apple) and AMD compile checks of the shipped
#      shaders; one failure stops the release.
#   4. Copies exactly the three shipped files into the SUBSCRIBED Workshop folder, then reads
#      the version and the file hashes back out of that folder to prove the copy landed.
#   5. Moves the local Addons\Mods copy out of the way, so the game loads ONE copy of the mod --
#      the subscribed one, whose Content Manager button reads "Update". A local copy beside it
#      is how a "Share" button (= a brand-new Workshop item) appears; with the folder gone that
#      click cannot be made.
#   6. Prints what is left to do by hand.
#
# Why the subscribed folder: a mod's published id comes from its folder name (PluginInfo), so
# only the copy in steamapps\workshop\content\255710\3805863507 knows it is item 3805863507.
