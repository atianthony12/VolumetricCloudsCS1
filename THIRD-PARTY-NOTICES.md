# Third-Party Notices

Volumetric Weather is an unofficial mod for Cities: Skylines 1. This file records what in the
repository is not original work, and what is credited rather than incorporated.

Apart from the two shader ports described below, and a few lines of a third shader copied from
one of them, this repository contains no game code and no game assets. The game's DLLs are referenced from your own installation at build time and are
never copied into the repository or the distribution.

## Shipped with the mod

Both of these are redistributed alongside `VolumetricClouds.dll`, which is the standard pattern
in this ecosystem.

| Component | Author | Licence | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`UnifiedUILib.dll`](https://github.com/kianzarrin/UnifiedUI) | kianzarrin | MIT | Registers the mod's button with Unified UI, and hosts the button panel itself when the Unified UI mod is not enabled |
| [`CitiesHarmony.API.dll`](https://github.com/boformer/CitiesHarmony) | boformer | MIT | Bootstrap shim: waits for the Harmony mod and prompts the player to install it if it is missing |

## Shaders reconstructed from the game

`UnityProject/Assets/VolumetricClouds/LightHalo.shader` and `LightHaloDynamic.shader` are
hand-written ports of Cities: Skylines' own light halo shader, `Custom/Lights/GroupVolume` —
the batched variant and the instanced variant respectively. They were reconstructed from the
Direct3D 11 disassembly of the compiled original and deliberately kept close to its instruction
order, so that with their controls at neutral values they reproduce the original's output and
can be A/B tested against it in-game. The changes are a fix for the shader's NaN case (which
paints a light's whole quad solid at fog values at or below -0.5), the added brightness,
tightness and radius controls, and a per-light near-camera blend.

They exist solely for interoperability: the game reads its halo material at draw time, so
replacing the material is the only way to change how halos are drawn. The original shader is
the work of **Colossal Order Ltd.**, who hold whatever rights attach to it. These two files
are excluded from the MIT licence that covers the rest of this repository (see `LICENSE`), and
no ownership of the original's design is claimed.

`FogLamps.shader` draws the same batched light meshes into the fog's light map, so it has to
switch each lamp on and off exactly as the halo does. Its blink table (`kBlink`) and the blink
and switch-on lines of its first pass's vertex shader are copied from `LightHalo.shader`, and
are excluded from the MIT licence in the same way. The rest of that file is original and
MIT-licensed.

`TreesDefault.shader`, `TreesGroup.shader` and their shared `TreesDefault.cginc` and
`TreesGroup.cginc` are reconstructions of the game's tree shaders, `Custom/Trees/Default` (near
trees) and `Custom/Trees/Group` (billboards), from the Direct3D 11 disassembly of the compiled
originals: the same surface functions, passes and shadow casters, so that with Volumetric
Weather's wind off they compute what the game's do (`tools/tree-bench.ps1` sets every compiled
program against the game's own and renders the two side by side). They too exist solely for
interoperability: the game reads its tree materials at draw time, so swapping the shader on them
is the only way to move its trees. The reconstructed parts — the surface, lighting and caster
code and the game's own sway (`VWGameSway`, `VWTreePhase`, the billboard geometry, the shadow
bias, the damage maps' lookup) — are the work of **Colossal Order Ltd.** and are excluded from the
MIT licence in the same way. The wind in `Trees.cginc` (`VWWindPoint` and what it calls) is
original and MIT-licensed. `TreeBenchGame*.shader` are bench-only copies with the wind compiled
out and are not shipped.

The disassembly itself is never committed. `tools/shaderdump.ps1` regenerates it from your own
installed copy of the game, and is the only way to verify a port.

## Techniques credited, not copied

The cloud modelling uses published techniques — Perlin-Worley noise, remap-based shaping and
erosion, a weather field controlling coverage — introduced by Andrew Schneider (Guerrilla
Games) in *The Real-Time Volumetric Cloudscapes of Horizon Zero Dawn*, SIGGRAPH 2015. The
technique is acknowledged here; the implementation in `CloudCommon.cginc`,
`CloudRaymarch.shader` and `CloudShadowMap.shader` was written for this mod.

Cloud detail and the Cumulus style (1.2) follow EVE-Redux, blackrack's volumetric clouds for
Kerbal Space Program ([LGhassen/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements](https://github.com/LGhassen/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements),
MIT): its "spherical" Worley noise and that noise's default octaves, its coverage, erosion and
edge-hardness model, the four phase lobes of its lighting, and the cumulus coverage curve of an
Earth-like configuration (Promised Worlds' Gurdamma). Those numbers and formulas were read from
its public C# code, wiki and configurations; EVE-Redux's shaders are not public and were not
used, and the implementation was written for this mod. The multiple-scattering octaves follow Magnus
Wrenninge (*Oz: The Great and Volumetric*, SIGGRAPH 2013) as presented by Sébastien Hillaire
(*Physically Based Sky, Atmosphere and Cloud Rendering in Frostbite*, SIGGRAPH 2016), the
weather map's normal scores use Peter Acklam's rational approximation of the normal quantile,
and the raymarches' blue-noise jitter is made with Robert Ulichney's void-and-cluster method
(*The void-and-cluster method for dither array generation*, SPIE 1993).

The trees' wind bends each tree about its base and puts every point back at its old distance from
it, so the tree leans instead of shearing — the main bending of Tiago Sousa's *Vegetation
Procedural Animation and Shading in Crysis* (*GPU Gems 3*, chapter 16, 2007), whose detail bending
also suggested the leaves' flutter weighted by a per-vertex mask (here the game's own sway weight).
The gust field's value noise hashes its cells with pcg2d from Mark Jarzynski and Marc Olano, *Hash
Functions for GPU Rendering* (Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques, 2020). Both were written for
this mod from the published descriptions.

Other mods were read to understand the game's behaviour and to stay compatible with them —
Unified UI, CitiesHarmony, Render It!, Theme Mixer, Intersection Marking Tool, Persistent Fog
Adjuster and Play It! among them. That study informed integration and compatibility decisions;
no source code from them is incorporated into this project. Where such a mod's behaviour
mattered, it was read from its IL.
