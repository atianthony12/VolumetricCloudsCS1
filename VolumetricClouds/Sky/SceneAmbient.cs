    /// Real Light (the author's own lighting mod) writes a much brighter trilight over the game's for
    /// the city's shade -- ~20x by day with Render It!'s sun -- which flattened the clouds' shaded side
    /// into their sunlit one. While it does, it publishes the game's own colour as the global
    /// _RLGameAmbientSky with _RLAmbientHeld 1; the clouds keep that, the light they were tuned in.
    ///
    /// The rain curtains, the rain streaks and the fog do NOT (<see cref="Air"/>): they hang in the
    /// city's air and are seen against the city, so they take the light the city is lit with. Given
    /// the game's colour too, they were lit ~20x dimmer than the city behind them, and the curtains
    /// all but vanished ("when it rains it's super clear", 2026-10-09).
    ///
    /// Real Light's own sky is drawn as bright as the sun the city is really lit with. The game
    /// combines a light's colour and intensity before it linearises them ((colour x intensity).linear,
    /// GraphicsSettings.lightsUseLinearIntensity false), while the clouds take colour.linear x
    /// intensity: with an intensity of 4.36 the real sun is 5.89x theirs. Against the game's sky,
    /// which never passes white, that never showed; against Real Light's (2-3x white) the clouds'
    /// shaded bases were ~8x darker than the sky behind them, which came through every thin part
    /// and flattened them (2026-10-10). While its sky is drawn Real Light publishes that ratio as
    /// _RLCloudLight (<see cref="CloudLight"/>), eased in with the sky's daytime opacity; the clouds'
    /// sun and shade are both multiplied by it, so their own contrast is as tuned.
    ///
    /// Without Real Light the flag reads 0, the two are the same colour, the multiplier is 1, and
    /// nothing changes.
