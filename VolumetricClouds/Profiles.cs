    /// PROFILES (1.3.0): whole skies saved under a name and picked at the top of the in-game

    /// the volumetric fog included, in files of their own.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// THE MODEL: a profile is a SAVED sky. Picking one puts its values in; what is changed after
    /// that belongs to the sky (VolumetricClouds.xml, as always) until "Save" writes it into the
    /// picked profile. "+" saves the sky as it is as a new profile and picks it; "-" deletes the
    /// picked one's file, the sky staying as it is; "Reset all" lets go -- which is where every
    /// player was before profiles (1.5.0: the list's "(no profile)" is gone). While the sky differs from the picked profile the bar says so,
    /// and picking another profile then asks first: it would throw those changes away.
    ///
    /// (The first build wrote every change into the picked profile too: no Save button, nothing
    /// ever unsaved. It failed the author's first test, 2026-09-29: he made "Cumulus", switched
    /// the style to Classic to make "Normal", and the switch went into "Cumulus" as well, so both
    /// held the same sky -- "when I switched to Cumulus from Normal everything just stayed on the
    /// Normal". He asked for a Save button.)
    ///
    /// Picking one puts ALL its values in (a value it lacks goes back to its default: a profile is
    /// a complete sky), the fog switch included: the player's own click on a sky they saved or
    /// chose, like "Reset all" (invariant 12).
    ///
    /// "(mod defaults)" (1.5.0, asked for by the author): a fixed entry that is the mod's own
    /// defaults -- it cannot be saved over or deleted. Picking it puts every default in; changing
    /// anything afterwards shows "(unsaved profile)" (Save names it as a new profile); picking it
    /// again throws those changes away. It is
    /// never a file nor a name in &lt;Profile&gt; (players already have profiles called "Default"):
    /// the bar shows it whenever no profile is picked and the sky is the defaults.
    ///
    /// Each profile is VolumetricCloudsProfiles\&lt;name&gt;.xml beside the settings file, in the
    /// settings file's own format: a player can send one to a friend, write one by hand, or drop
    /// one in the folder with the game running (the list is read again each time it opens). The
    /// name IS the file's name (<see cref="ProfileName"/>).
    ///
    /// The settings file stays the whole truth of the sky, unsaved changes included, across a
    /// restart; its &lt;Profile&gt; only names the pick. At startup the picked profile's file is
    /// READ, never applied: only to know whether the sky still matches it. While the game runs it
    /// is watched once a second: a hand edit of it is taken as if it were picked again, and a file
    /// deleted on disk is let go, never written back. A file that cannot be read is never written
    /// over, except by the player's own Save.
    ///
