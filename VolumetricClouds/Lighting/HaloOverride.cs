    /// <remarks>
    /// Street and building lamps are batched at EVERY distance, not only far away (read from
    /// the IL, after believing otherwise): LightEffect.RenderEffect returns at once for a
    /// batched light that belongs to an instance, and LightEffect.PopulateGroupData raises the
    /// layer's maxRenderDistance to 30 km while never touching maxInstanceDistance, so
    /// RenderGroup.Render never trades the mesh for instances. A lamp 20 m from the camera is
    /// drawn by the same mesh layer, and so by the same replacement material, as one 5 km
    /// away -- which is why the near/far distinction is made inside the shader, per light.
    ///
    /// Those meshes are drawn by RenderGroup.RenderMesh / MegaRenderGroup.RenderMesh. Each
    /// light layer is drawn TWICE, with two materials that are read at draw time every frame:
    ///   m_bufferMaterial (the "Batched lights" CommandBuffer) = the surface illumination
    ///   m_renderMaterial (Graphics.DrawMesh)                  = the halo, 'GroupVolume'
    /// This class swaps m_renderMaterial for a material of its own. The game's materials are
    /// never modified, so switching the feature off is exact: put the references back.
    ///
    /// The swap is made at the SOURCE too: LightSystem.m_lightMaterialVolumeGroup and
    /// m_lightFloatingMaterialVolumeGroup, the two fields RenderGroup.UpdateMesh (and the mega
    /// variant) copy into a light layer whenever it rebuilds. A layer is rebuilt when anything
    /// in its 384 m cell changes -- a building finished, upgraded, zoned -- and the rebuild runs
    /// INSIDE the game's draw: RenderManager.LateUpdate -> RenderGroup.Render finds the layer
    /// dirty, UpdateMesh writes the material, and RenderMesh draws with it in the same call. A
    /// per-frame swap of the layers alone therefore always lost that frame: the cell's lamps
    /// flashed the game's big soft halos for one frame per rebuild (reported by a player in
    /// 1.0.0; `swapsSinceLastLog` counted 3-25 such layers per 5 s while the city grew). Nothing
    /// else in the game reads those two fields (IL: InitializeProperties creates them,
    /// DestroyProperties destroys them), and no installed mod names them.
    ///
    /// Why a replacement shader rather than feeding the game's one: disassembled, its glow is
    /// 0.001 * (fog + 0.5) * (1/x - 1), raised to a power via exp(log()). Fog is therefore
    /// only a brightness knob, there is no control over falloff or size at all, and at
    /// fog &lt;= -0.5 the log() is NaN and Direct3D's min(NaN, 1) paints the light's whole quad
    /// at full colour -- the "box". LightHalo.shader is a port of that shader with the glow
    /// clamped positive and brightness, tightness and radius exposed; LightHaloDynamic.shader
    /// is the same port of the instanced variant the dynamic lights (vehicles, and lamps drawn
    /// without an instance id) use.
    ///
    /// ONE switch (1.1.0, the author's call: "just settle for one checkbox"): `HaloEnabled`
    /// puts the ported shaders on every batched light layer and on the dynamic lights'
    /// material; off leaves the game's materials exactly as they are. Until 1.1.0 a second
    /// switch could keep the game's shader with only its fog overridden, and the dynamic
    /// material was pinned to the smallest glow that shader survives (-0.49); both are gone,
    /// and so is the "Fog amount" slider. The fog the halos see is the WORLD's: what the
    /// game's own shader reads (see <see cref="HaloFog"/>), so foggy weather and Play It!'s
    /// fog slider bloom the lamps as they do in vanilla ("let other mods like Play It or the
